# Facebook Fix: Facebook Not Showing the Correct Title for Website



Just had a client have a problem with Facebook and their WordPress blog. They created a post, and after publishing it, realized that they written the title wrong. So they went back and fixed it. However, whenever someone posted that site URL onto Facebook, it showed the old title, not the new one. Obviously, this needed to be fixed.

In today’ fast paced world, we’re used to things happening In Real Time. Even though it looks like Facebook connects to your site instantly, in reality it only looks at your site once every two days, and then caches what it sees. If it caches your site at the wrong time, you may see the wrong things up on Facebook.  But have no fear: Help is here!

All you need to do is tell Facebook to re-cache your page.  But how do you do that? Very simple: Go to the Facebook Debugger page and put in the URL of your page that you want corrected. By doing so, you are forcing Facebook to “refresh” it’s cache (much like pressing CTRL + F5 will refresh your browser).

Knowing how Facebook interacts with your site will go a long way in helping you troubleshoot any problems you may have with it.
